You've got it! Chris was trying to send us a message: he's returning from New Zealand
via Chicago, no doubt to try and throw the feds off his trail.
</p>
<p>
He's in deeper trouble than he realizes, though. Chris King has now been convicted in
absentia on numerous counts of copyright infringement! The second the feds get their
hands on him, they'll toss him into a maximum security prison to serve seventeen
consecutive life sentences.
</p>
<p>
If we ever want to see Chris again, there’s only one thing we can do:
Hack into the Department of Justice and destroy all the evidence of his numerous crimes.
Can we count on you?
